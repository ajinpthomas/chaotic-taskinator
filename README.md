# TaskMaster 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Codex


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Ajin P Thomas - MBCCET
- Member 2: Nevin G Shaji - MBCCET


### Project Description
A completely useless to-do list app designed to waste your time, confuse your brain, and sabotage productivity in the most creative ways possible.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This project solves the non-problem of being too productive.
In a world obsessed with getting things done, this app fights back by making sure you get absolutely nothing done — but with style, flickers, runaway buttons, and fake alerts.
It's the perfect tool for procrastinators who want to feel busy without achieving anything.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By unleashing a chaotic symphony of flickering colors, runaway keyboards, fake reminders, and mocking alerts — we’ve created an environment where doing literally anything is a heroic challenge. Productivity? Never heard of her

TaskMaster – The Anti-Productivity To-Do List App
This glorious mess features a runaway input field, a useless on-screen keyboard that avoids interaction, sarcastic AI commentary, and a premium upgrade prompt that does absolutely nothing. Welcome to the chaos.

TaskMaster in Full Chaos Mode
Tasks float freely, the keyboard has scattered in protest, the AI assistant mocks your efforts, and the premium popup politely scams you. "Stare at the wall" is the only goal, and frankly, it’s the most achievable one here.

Every time you try to delete a task like “Count to potato” or “Water the USB port,” the app laughs in your face with an alert: “DELETE FAILED: This task is immortal.” Welcome to the eternal backlog — resistance is futile.

This video demonstrates the full absurdity of TaskMaster, a purposely useless to-do list app. As shown:
The input box avoids the user, running away when hovered.
The keyboard letters appear but are completely non-functional — clicking them triggers useless alerts, and they randomly shift around.
Tasks like “Count to potato” and “Water the USB port” are automatically generated.
Trying to delete a task? You’ll be greeted with an alert saying: “DELETE FAILED: This task is immortal.”
A sarcastic AI assistant reminds you how pointless everything is.
Fake popups appear to sell you Useless PRO for $99/month.


## Team Contributions
-  Ajin P Thomas: Developed the overall structure and layout using HTML and CSS.
Coded the runaway input box, floating tasks, and fake delete buttons.
Designed the visual chaos (color flickers, animations, task hover effects)
-  Nevin G Shaji: Implemented the fake keyboard and prevented real typing.
Created the mock AI assistant, premium popup, and random alerts.
Set up task automation, reminders, and all things unnecessary but hilarious.
